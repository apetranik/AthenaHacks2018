      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Join us for a weekend dedicated to <b>filling the gender gap</b>,
        exploring technology, and building the next big thing! Our mission
        is to support and nurture women* in tech by hosting Southern
        California's premiere <b>all female* hackathon</b>. Expect a weekend
        full of workshops, mentorship, tech talks, social activities, food,
        and more! No experience necessary, you just need passion.

          <p>
            From hardware to mobile, there are so many fields to
            explore! We want women to explore their ideas and interests, and
            are looking forward to some amazing projects!

            We're all about helping each other grow! We hope to foster a
            supportive environment so that each participant at AthenaHacks
            feels welcome and comfortable.

            Right now, only 20% of hackathon participants are women. We hope
            to fill that gap by providing a comfortable environment that is
            focused on learning and exploring!

          <h3 class="question">What's a hackathon?
            <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            A hackathon is a weekend-long gathering of curious minds to learn something new. Often times, attendees do this by picking up a project of their choosing to work on for the weekend. This is a great way to really dive into a topic you've been meaning to explore and you'll get to make new friends as you work in a team! Hackathons provide other ways to learn, too - you can attend workshops, listen to speakers, or network and meet with other students and representatives from companies!

          <h3 class="question">Can I attend?
            <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            If you are an undergraduate, graduate, or high school female* who loves to hack, the answer is <b>YES</b>! Women* in industry are welcome to mentor! If you identify as male, we're sorry to say this hacking environment is not for you. This hackathon is about bringing women together in a comfortable setting. However, if you are a male interested in helping our cause, we'd love to have you as a mentor or volunteer! Reach out to us at athenahacks@gmail.com.

          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            If you're a high schooler who will be at least 17 years old by AthenaHacks, you are invited to AthenaHacks! You will need to have your parent/guardian pick you up for the evening and then return you back on Sunday morning, however.

          </h3>

            No! This is the perfect place for any student to create their first coding project or for more experienced individuals to learn even more and build a great project! We'll have plenty of resources for beginners to get started!
